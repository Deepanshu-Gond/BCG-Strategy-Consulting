# BCG: Strategy Consulting

In this virtual experience program, I got to complete similar work that consultants do at BCG. I gained enviable insight into what itâ€™s like to solve meaningful challenges with our diverse and forward-thinking team. I worked as consultant for a virtual Company X.

## Background

Company X is a local telecom company and is facing a decline in profits over the past few years. BCG has been engaged to drive improvements in profitability. One of the hypotheses under consideration is the introduction of handset leasing.

Handset leasing works by renting new phones to customers for a monthly fee instead of selling phones to customers at a discounted upfront cost. Customers lease phones for a fixed term (usually 12 months), before they swap their used phone for a new model. This allows customers to change their phones more frequently without incurring upfront costs of buying phones through retail, or affecting their mobile plans. For the telcos, this reduces their need to hold inventory, and reduces their financing costs, both of which can help profitability.

## Task 1: Market Research

I did some research and identify markets in which handset leasing has already been introduced. I analysed reports on the impact on revenue and profits for the telecom companies operating in those markets, and summarised my findings in an email stating whether this is an attractive business model for the team to explore further.

## Task 2: Data analysis - Foundations

Learned basic fundamental financial terms before conducting analyses.

## Task 3: Data Analysis - Modelling

Analysed the data from Company A and Company B to determine the impact of leasing handsets on financial performance.

Applied my own assumptions, and identified the metrics to perform a financial forecast for Company X. Calculated and compared forecasts of Company A and B to calculate the net impact of leasing.

## Task 4: Understanding consumer needs

Evaluated whether the new option would be attractive to customers. Brainstormed and shortlisted criteria that customers may use to evaluate competing offers. Based on given data, I filled in evaluation matrix and identified the target segment for this plan.  

Given the target segment, identified changes to the offering that would make it more attractive for them.

## Task 5: Client Recommendation

Developed an executive summary slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far.

## Task 6: Next Steps

- Identified two departments that may have the greatest concerns/objections
- What their specific issues might be
- How we can address/mitigate those concern
